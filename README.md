A place to learn C! 

The following sources were used to learn:
  - Papobinario channel C playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZeezrNHxVo&list=PLIfZMtpPYFP5qaS2RFQxcNVkmJLGQwyKE
  - The C Programming Language Book.
  
 For some questions and answers, these sites helped me a loooot:
  - GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
  - Tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm

As I continue to learn, I will add some more references!

This project is just a way to centralize all my notes and references! In any kind of way, i am trying with this project to teach someone else. But if you came here for some mysterious reason, I hope this reference material will help you! 

Yes, the description is in English and the project is in Portuguese... That's life!!
