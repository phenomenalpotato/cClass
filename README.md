A place to learn C!

The following sources were used to learn:

Papobinario channel playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZeezrNHxVo&list=PLIfZMtpPYFP5qaS2RFQxcNVkmJLGQwyKE
The C Programming Language Book.
For some questions and answers, these sites helped me a loooot:

GeeksforGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/
Tutorialspoint: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm
As I continue to learn, I will add some more references!

This project is just a way to centralize all my notes and references! In any kind of way, i am trying with this project to teach someone else. But if you came here for some mysterious reason, I hope this reference material will help you!

Yes, the description is in English and the project is in Portuguese... That's life!!
